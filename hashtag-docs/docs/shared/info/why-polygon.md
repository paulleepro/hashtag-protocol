## We're migrating to Polygon

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23582496/141384998-50b7c691-5f91-47ff-91a0-65a85a627029.png)

### Why the move?

Simply put: faster & cheaper transactions.

A high-volume, Web3 tagging protocol and Ethereum Mainnet are
incompatible. Therefore we are pivoting and redeploying Hashtag Protocol on
Polygon, arguably the most decentralized, battle tested & scalable Layer 2.


### Our new sandbox on Polygon Mumbai testnet

Please use this interface to experiment with tagging any
NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag string you can imagine.

If the tag is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT) will be minted
and your address is logged within it as the Creator and the platform hosting the
tagging event (in this case Hashtag Protocol) will be logged as the Publisher.
In the future, Creators and Publishers
will receive a royalty if the HASHTAG token is purchased at auction.

Please note, this sandbox is on Polygon Mumbai and should be used for **testing
purposes only**. No tokens or tagging data will be migrated to Polygon Mainnet.

[Learn more](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/participants.html)
about Publishers, Creators & Taggers, the three early market participants of the
Hashtag Protocol.

### Early adoption opportunities

For Creators, you can continue to mint HASHTAG tokens using our dApp on
[Ethereum Mainnet](https://app.hashtag-protocol.org/). Mind you, it usually
costs over $100 in gas.

All HASHTAG tokens on Ethereum Mainnet will be migrated immediately prior to our
launch on Polygon Mainnet. All token provenance, including hashtag string,
Creator address and Publisher address, will be preserved.

For Publishers, we are seeking three-five "launch partners" who wish to
implement decentralized tagging on their platform. As early adopters, launch
partners will have opportunity to be publisher of record for the highest value
HASHTAG tokens. If a HASHTAG token is purchased at auction, the Publisher of
record will receive a portion of the sale revenue.

### What is Hashtag Protocol?

A new Web3 tagging standard that aims to do for content tagging what ENS,
Unstoppable Domains and Handshake have done for DNS.
